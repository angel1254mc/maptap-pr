# MapTap PR — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-07-04
**Status:** Approved (design), pending implementation via one-shot agent (Fable)

## Summary

A frontend-only geography guessing game for Puerto Rico, modeled on
[maptap.gg](https://maptap.gg/). The player is shown a satellite map of the
Puerto Rico archipelago and prompted to "Tap as close as you can to **X**",
where X is a municipio, landmark, or barrio. Scoring is distance-based over 5
rounds. No backend in v1; the architecture leaves room to add one later.

## Goals

- Faithful recreation of maptap's core loop, scoped to Puerto Rico.
- Frontend-only, deployable as a static site.
- Data-driven so content (locations) can be corrected/expanded without code
  changes.
- Clean enough to grow a backend onto later (accounts, leaderboards, daily
  puzzle).

## Non-Goals (v1)

- User accounts / authentication.
- Server-side leaderboards or persistence (localStorage best-score only).
- Daily-puzzle server / shared seed.
- MapLibre GL / vector tiles (Leaflet + raster satellite is the chosen path).

## Gameplay

- **Session:** 5 rounds, cumulative score. Max 25,000 (5,000/round).
- **Round:** show prompt "Tap as close as you can to **{name}**" (with a
  category + difficulty tag). Player pans/zooms the satellite map and taps
  once. On tap:
  - Drop the player's pin.
  - Reveal the true location marker.
  - Draw a line between guess and truth.
  - Show distance (m under 1 km, else km to 1 decimal) and round points.
  - "Next" advances; after round 5, show results.
- **Results screen:** total score, per-round breakdown (name, distance,
  points), and a shareable text summary. Persist best score in localStorage.
- **Round draw:** 5 distinct locations selected at random from the pool with
  category variety (avoid all-same-category games). No repeats within a game.

## Scoring

- Haversine great-circle distance `d` (km) between guess and target.
- `points = round(5000 * Math.exp(-d / 10))`, clamped to `[0, 5000]`.
  - 0 km → 5000, 1 km → ~4520, 5 km → ~3030, 10 km → ~1840, 20 km → ~680.
- Scale factor `10` is tuned to PR's size (~180 km E–W); kept as a named
  constant for easy tuning.

## Map

- **Engine:** `react-leaflet` (Leaflet). Chosen for one-shot reliability:
  bulletproof click handling, markers, and polyline distance line with raster
  tiles.
- **Base layer:** Esri World Imagery —
  `https://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}`,
  attribution "Tiles © Esri". No API key required. (Licensing note below.)
- **View lock:** `maxBounds` to the PR archipelago (SW `[17.8, -68.0]`, NE
  `[18.6, -65.1]`) so the player can't pan off into blank ocean/world.
  `minZoom ≈ 9`, `maxZoom ≈ 16`, initial view fit to the main island.
- The true-location marker and the line are hidden until the player taps.

## Data

Single data-driven module `src/data/locations.ts` (already built & vetted,
committed in this repo). Shape:

```ts
export interface GameLocation {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  category: 'municipio' | 'landmark' | 'barrio';
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
  lat: number;
  lng: number;
}
export const LOCATIONS: GameLocation[];
```

**Contents (120 locations):**

- **78 municipios** — GeoNames `PPLA` town-seat coordinates (authoritative).
  Difficulty auto-tiered by municipio population (easy ≥60k, medium ≥20k,
  hard <20k).
- **26 landmarks** — hand-verified coordinates (El Morro, Castillo San
  Cristóbal, La Fortaleza, Observatorio de Arecibo, El Yunque, Cerro de Punta,
  the offshore islands Mona/Culebra/Vieques/Desecheo/Caja de Muertos, Playa
  Flamenco, Bahía Mosquito, Camuy caves, Bacardí, etc.).
- **16 barrios** — curated approximate neighborhood centroids (Viejo San Juan,
  Santurce, Río Piedras, Condado, Isla Verde, Hato Rey, Piñones, Guavate, La
  Perla, Boquerón, …). Approximate by nature; flagged in the data comments.

**Sources:** GeoNames PR export (`download.geonames.org/export/dump/PR.zip`)
for municipio seats and geographic features; hand-curation for landmarks and
barrios. Barrio coordinates are the weakest link and are the first thing to
harden in a later pass (TIGER/Line county-subdivision + subbarrio shapefiles
are the authoritative upgrade path).

## Architecture / Components

- `App` — top-level state machine: `idle → playing(round n) → revealed → …
  → results`.
- `MapView` — Leaflet map, satellite layer, bounds lock, tap handler, and
  guess/truth markers + line for the revealed state.
- `RoundPrompt` — shows the target name, category/difficulty tag, round
  counter, running score.
- `RoundResult` — distance + points panel, "Next" button.
- `Results` — final score, per-round table, share summary, "Play again".
- `lib/scoring.ts` — `haversineKm(a, b)` and `scoreForDistance(km)`.
- `lib/game.ts` — round selection (random, distinct, category-varied).
- `data/locations.ts` — the vetted dataset (this repo).

State is local React state; no global store needed at this size. The
`data/locations.ts` interface and the `lib/*` pure functions are the seams a
future backend plugs into (fetch locations remotely, post scores, fetch daily
seed).

## Error / Edge Handling

- Tap outside `maxBounds` is clamped by Leaflet (bounds lock), so guesses are
  always on-map.
- Tile load failure: Leaflet shows blank tiles; acceptable for v1 (no offline
  fallback). Attribution always rendered.
- No network for data — dataset is bundled, so the game works offline after
  first tile cache.

## Testing

- Unit-test `lib/scoring.ts` (`haversineKm` against known distances;
  `scoreForDistance` monotonic + endpoints).
- Unit-test `lib/game.ts` round selection (5 distinct, in-pool, variety).
- Manual/visual QA of the map interaction (tap → reveal → score).

## Licensing Note

Esri World Imagery is used key-free with attribution for this prototype. Its
ToS restricts commercial use; when the project goes public or adds a backend,
switch the base layer to **MapTiler Satellite** (free tier, API key) or **EOX
Sentinel-2 Cloudless** (no key, CC-BY, lower max resolution). The base-layer
URL is isolated to one place in `MapView` to make this a one-line swap.

## Deliverable

The implementation is produced by a separate one-shot agent (Fable) from a
prompt that embeds the full vetted `locations.ts` inline (so the agent invents
no coordinates). See `FABLE_PROMPT.md` in the repo root.
